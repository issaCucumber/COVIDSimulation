# COVID Simulation
This project is a simple web application to simulate COVID spread in a designated population.
To simulate how the spread of COVID can be controlled, the following parameters are defined and can be adjusted:
1. Population size
2. Activity frame constraint
3. Vaccinated percentage
4. Vaccination successful rate
5. Masked percentage
6. Masked successful rate
7. Quarantine
8. Incubation period of COVID

Here is the snapshot of how the simulation looks like:

In the default setting, the particles move freely within the frame. The simulation will automatically stop when the population is fully infected.

To run the simulation, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
